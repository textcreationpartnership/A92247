            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REASONS <hi>Humbly Offered for Continuing the Right of Foreign-Built Ships, now belonging to Engliſh Owners, to Load at and from any of the Plantations for</hi> England <hi>directly.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Intent of the Bill for Preventing Abuſes Committed to the prejudice of the Plantation-Trade, particularly by the <hi>Scotch,</hi> and to hinder the Trading in Foreign-Built Ships from Port to Port, and from one Colony to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Plantations, being now before your Lordſhips,</p>
            <p>It is Humbly propoſed to your Lordſhip's Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the preſent War hath very much decreaſed the Shipping of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> eſpecially thoſe Employed in the Plantation-Trade, ſo many having been Taken, and Loſt. The Conſequences of the War have made all Materials for Building Ships very dear, and the Great Occaſion the King hath for Shipwrights, makes Building not only very Charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but alſo Dilatory, for want of Ship-Carpenters, and altogether a great diſcouragement to Build many Ships during the War.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That Foreign-Built Ships, Called Engliſh Shipping, as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Bona Fide</hi> wholly to Engliſh Owners, and Bought for Valuable Conſiderations, and Navigated with the Maſter and three fourths Engliſh Seamen, are not even in Times of Peace Excluded by the Act of Navigation, nor by the Act of Frauds, from going to the Plantations to load there for <hi>England</hi> directly, Paying Aliens Cuſtoms if not made Free.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That during this War, there hath been a want of Shipping to bring off the Yearly Product of the Plantations, the Natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences whereof are High Freights, and few Goods, and thoſe Sold Dear here, and but little left to be Exported to Foreign Markets, for the want whereof we ſuffer ſo much in the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and are forc'd to ſend out the more Mony.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That the Engliſh Merchants and Traders in this Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> debar'd by the ſaid Acts of Navigation and Frauds to Trade with Foreign-Built Ships, under the Conditions therein mentioned, have always been poſſeſs'd of ſuch Ships, whereby the Cuſtoms as well as the Trade have been Increaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis therefore Humbly Hoped that ſuch Proviſion may be made in the ſaid Bill, as may Preſerve the Right and Property of the Subjects to continue ſuch Foreign-Built Ships in the Plantation-Trade as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time they are Poſſeſs'd and Owners of. Provided they do not Trade from Port to Port in the Plantations, nor from one Colony to another.</hi>
